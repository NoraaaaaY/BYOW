## Classes and Data Structures
1. Point
   - stores the coordinates of each tile / box
   

2. Room
   
   - should have something that stores all rooms - hashset
   - the inner tiles are floors and the outer tiles would be walls

3. Hallway
   - Option1: room with width 1 but random length
   - Option2: different method?
   - Option3: Use DFS to traversal over all rooms and "open paths"?
   - corner hallways - 2 L or crossing?

4. MapGenerator
    - connect rooms and hallways
      

   

## Algorithms
1. Generate random rooms. Each room is a HashSet of Points. 
   

## Persistence
